my very first respository!

Rules when editing:
1) create a new branch
2) createa a matching pull request
3) Merge the pull request into the main branch 
4) it's bad practice to push changes directly to main branch
 
 Using Source Control on the right hand side you can create new branches (you can tell whcih is which by the bottom right side)
